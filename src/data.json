Due to the nature of their business and customer expectations, they developed a unique process for order fulfillment that required pen and paper tracking. Gadget Software created a dedicated order fulfillment application to simplify and automate it.",
      "impact": "Impact: One of their primary partners was able to save X hours a week, previously allocated to a repetitive setup and verification of our previous paper-led order fulfillment process. Errors in the packing step of order fulfillment have gone down by X%, and the speed and consistency increases have resulted in X, Y, and Z for Fruchtbote."

Software, while a complicated craft is not unteachable in its methodologies. The paths to failure are many, but the ones to success are few. From years of hard fought, acquired knowledge in the industry, we at Gadget Software have a pretty solid understanding of the patterns of what causes success and failure in any software project. Let us take you by the hand and get you focusing on what matters rather than the endless triviality that can distract you from getting your project done."
